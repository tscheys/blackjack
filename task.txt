+ Dealer behavior: (Greater > 17 rule)
+ Busting (player/dealer over 21)
+ Push/ties
+ Ace behavior (1 or 11-- whatever makes the best card hand)
+ Hit/stand behavior
+ Dealer vs player-- player makes decisions, dealer follows rules


DECISION: 1 deck of 52 or several decks of 52? Single deck with TRACKING

DECISION: How to model cards: "Ace" [1 or 11], 2 to 10, 10 (jack),10 (queen)(,10 
{"ace": function(){ if (ace == 11) player.total < 21 return if (ace ===1) player > 21}}, {1:1}, {jack: 10}, {queen: 10}
//Note: Same ace behavior for dealer

2) Backbone
+ Model:
ourCards = [{value: 2, suit: "hearts"}, {valueadfasd}]
  * Card model
    --name: jack/king/queen/ace
    --suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades
    --value: 2-10...something special for aces
    --4 groups of 13 cards [52 total cards]




 * Table collection: cardtable Collection

  * Cards colleciton [dealer deck? player deck?]
  -- Single deck of 52 cards keep tracking of what's currently in there
  ---Remove from collection

  * Hands Collection for player
  --total: compute card values
  --Listens for "hit event" trigger from playerHandView.
    --Select a random card from the deck. Put it in the hand collection
    --Special case: If player goes bust, render dealer's hidden card


  * Hands Collection for dealer
  --total: compute card values

+ View:
  * Table view

    * playerHandView
    --Hit: emits/trigger "hit event"
      --hit event function: triggers
    

    --Stand: emits/trigger "stand event"
      --hit event function: triggers
    * dealerHandView
  



Hit procedure:
1) give a random card to the player
2) re-render playerView
3) recalculate total
4) alert if necessary
++

Stand procedure:
0) Render the dealer's hidden card
1) Go through Dealer stand conditions
2) Recalculate each time a card gets added


Dealer stand conditions:
0) Blackjack for dealer: dealer total === 21
1) push: deealer total === player total. It's a tie.
2) Continue random card: dealer total < 17
2a) bust: dealer total > 21
2b) recheck for base cases
3) Dealer Wins:  dealer.total > player.total

+ Controller evaluates our hand
+ Initialize
  --Pick card randomly
+ Hit and Stand Implemtnation
+ Hit: Player gets a new random card
+ 

helpers function:
* Over/under 21? >> alert busts/pushes/etc
* currentTotal Calculation: Calculate card value for player or dealer, adjust for ace behavior if ace is in their deck.
* win/lose alert
* give a random card (that hasn't been drawn yet) to whatever model needs it (dealer or player) remove()
CardsCollection.at(Math.random*CardsCollection.length);
